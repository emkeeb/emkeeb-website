# Welcome!

This project is to help facilitate my online keyboard business :)
The main goal is to have a central area with links to social media, current keyboards, and where I can take buld requests.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

\*\*\* testing is currently a work in progress
